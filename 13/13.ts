// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as â€œI would like to own a Honda motorcycle.

let arr = ["CD125", "bike" , "CD70"]
console.log(`I would like to own a ${arr[0]} motorcycle`);
console.log(`I dislike  ${arr[1]} motorcycle`);
console.log(`${arr[2]} love this bike`);
