// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as â€œI would like to own a Honda motorcycle.
var arr = ["CD125", "bike", "CD70"];
console.log("I would like to own a ".concat(arr[0], " motorcycle"));
console.log("I dislike  ".concat(arr[1], " motorcycle"));
console.log("".concat(arr[2], " love this bike"));
